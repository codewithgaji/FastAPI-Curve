# FastAPI Curve 🚀

This repository documents my journey learning **FastAPI** by building real-world backend systems step by step.

The goal of this repo is not just theory, but **practical backend API development**, covering authentication, voting systems, and data-driven features like graphing and analytics.

---

## 🎯 Purpose of This Repository

This repo is used to:

- Learn **FastAPI fundamentals**
- Build **RESTful backend APIs**
- Understand **request validation & response serialization**
- Implement **authentication & authorization**
- Design **voting / polling systems**
- Build **data & graph-ready APIs**
- Practice **clean backend architecture**

All projects here are built incrementally, from simple examples to more advanced

## 🛠️ What I’m Building with FastAPI

### 1. Core API Features
- CRUD operations
- Path & query parameters
- Request body validation with Pydantic
- Proper HTTP status codes
- Error handling with exceptions

### 2. Authentication & Authorization
- User registration & login
- Password hashing
- JWT-based authentication
- Role-based access control
- Protected routes

### 3. Voting & Polling Systems
- Create polls
- Cast votes
- Prevent duplicate voting
- Real-time-ready vote counts
- Secure vote tracking

### 4. Data & Graphing APIs
- Analytics endpoints
- Aggregated statistics
- APIs designed for charts & dashboards
- Backend support for:
  - Bar charts
  - Line graphs
  - Pie charts

(FastAPI handles the backend — frontend graphing tools consume the data.)
